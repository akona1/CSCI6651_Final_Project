# CSCI6651_Final_Project
## Dynamic Firewall
Our project centers around hardening Linux based web servers or other Linux hosts exposed to the internet.

We created what is essentially an add-on module for any Linux host running Firewalld. Clients automatically drop connections from known hostile IP's harvested by a HoneyPot.

The module consists of (2) Python programs, client.py and update_fw.py, that users run out of cron.

The clients connect to a HoneyPot (Digital Ocean Droplet) which runs server.py. this program makes a DB of hostile IP's available to clients.

The DB is generated by a shell script (get_ips.sh) and a Python program (update_db.py) which run on the HoneyPot.
